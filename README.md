directed-graph-creator
======================

This is an extended version of directed-graph-creator from: https://github.com/cjrd/directed-graph-creator

Interactive tool for creating directed graphs, created using d3.js. The graph can be created on a background image.

My contributions:
* Added labels to the edges.
* ctrl+click to change a node label.

Operation:

* drag/scroll to translate/zoom the graph
* shift-click on graph to create a node
* shift-click on a node and then drag to another node to connect them with a directed edge
* ctrl-click on a node to change its title
* click on node or edge and press backspace/delete to delete
